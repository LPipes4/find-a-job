# find-a-job
Find a job optimization project prototypes

A collaboration between TBS Digital Transformation Office, Public Service Commission of Canada, and Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). The targets for this project are to improve user success by at least 20 points at finding job postings for Government of Canada jobs. If more Canadians can find job postings, this would contribute to the outcome of more Canadians applying to these jobs. 

This repo holds a prototyped version of Canada.ca paths to ways to find Government of Canada jobs.  An initial baseline round of task-scenario testing on the live version of Canada.ca highlighted critical usability problems, with a success rate of only 59% overall. Working together as a collaborative team across the departments, we will design and implement solutions in these prototype pages.  A second round of validation testing with a different set of Canadian participants is planned for early September. Participants in that study will use this prototype rather than the live set, to test that the success rates are improved. 

To try out the prototyped site, start from the Canada.ca home page of the prototype and follow the Find a job path.
